// This file contains notes on the data sources used in the project.

/// Data Sources:

/// 1. IPSA
//    - Source:
https://www.ipsa.org.uk
//    - Description:
The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) provides data on MPs' expenses and allowances.
//    - Collection:
Data is available programmatically as CSV for each member using their numeric ID, e.g.
https://www.theipsa.org.uk/api/mp/expenses?mpId=4514 for Keir Starmer.
However, I found that this information seemed to be less up-to-date than what appeared on the webpage.
As a result, I used a web scrape to populate with the information I need.
<<<CHECK FOR REFACTOR BEFORE PUBLISHING>>>
The function get_mps_ipsa_data in expenses_web_scrape.py handles this for all 650 current MPs.
//    - Data Format:
JSON
//    - Usage:
The primary function of IPSA is to provide members' business expenses and staffing costs.
I also use it as a source for key biographical information, such as name, current party and gender.
Throughout this project I use the numeric ID for MPs given by IPSA.
This is the same numerical ID used by parliament.uk on the register of interests.


// 2. Parliament Register of Interests
//    - Source:
https://www.parliament.uk
//    - Description:
Parliament provides a list register of interests for each member.
//    - Collection:
The APIs are used to retrieve current and historical registers of interests for all members.
Care has to be taken here to update, rather than delete, past records.
//    - Data Format:
CSV
//    - Usage:
The register of interests is used throughout for things like outside earnings, paid travel, landlord income, gifts and hospitality.

// 3. Parliament Register of Commons Votes API
// - Source:
https://commonsvotes-api.parliament.uk
// - Description:
The Commons Votes API provides data on votes in the House of Commons.
// - Collection:
The API is used to retrieve data on one vote at a time, using the vote ID.
This is done at user request, as it's hard to see a use case for mass downloads.
// - Data Format:
JSON raw and .txt of members' IDs based on voting direction.
// - Usage:
Primarily used to filter based on voting direction, e.g. to display all MPs who voted 'Aye' on a particular vote.
